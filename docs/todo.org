SignalListItemFactory actually might be a valid work arround..
** larger font
** opacity when open or something else
** light dark toggle
* DONE Better status bar
* DONE Better shortcuts
** Shortcuts window
* DONE Save settings (width & height & mines configs)
* DONE Fixed size for cells (char size is affecting!)
just add padding as px
